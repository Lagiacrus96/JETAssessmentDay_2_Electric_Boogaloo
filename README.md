# JETAssessmentDay


This is my JET Assessment Day simple web application that displays a "Hello, World!" message.

## Overview

This web application project aims to demonstrate my abilities at basic web development, and is a start for future web deployment.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, clone the repository on your local machine.

## Further steps

Following my current progess, I would launch it on the ec2 instance that I have configured to be open to http traffic. You can ssh into it at ec2-user@18.192.127.182. I have added the key pair to this GitHub to allow this (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ANY OTHER PROJECT.)
